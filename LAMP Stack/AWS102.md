# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS

LAMP is a popular open-source software stack commonly used for building dynamic websites and web applications. It stands for:

Linux: This is the foundation of the LAMP stack. It's a free and open-source operating system that provides the platform on which the other components run. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

Apache: This is the web server software that sits on top of the Linux operating system. Apache is responsible for processing incoming web requests, managing traffic, and serving content to users' browsers.

MySQL: This is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing the dynamic content of websites and applications. MySQL allows you to create databases, store data in tables, and retrieve information based on user interaction or application needs.

PHP (or Perl/Python): This is the programming language used to develop the dynamic functionality of web applications. This language processes user input, interact with the MySQL database, and generate tailored web pages for users.

## STEP 0 - Preparing Prerequisites.

To complete the project, we need an AWS account and Ubuntu OS.
Because I am using widows, I decided to install Ubuntu virtual server using Windows Powershell.  
You have to ensure you have admin rights before installing Linux. To check if you have the ubuntu virtual server installed in your machine you enter this command in powershell

          wsl -v

It should return this:

If you don't have it installed use this command

         wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04

Next, we need the AWS free virtual server called EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud).
