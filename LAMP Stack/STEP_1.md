# STEP 1 - Installing Apache & Updating the Firewall.

Apache refers to the Apache HTTP Server, a free and open-source web server software. It's one of the most popular web servers globally, powering a significant portion of the websites you visit.  
Apache acts as a middleman between a web browser and the web server that stores a website's files. It's responsible for several key tasks:

- Receiving Requests: Apache listens for incoming requests from web browsers. These requests typically specify a web page (like https://bloomfire.com/resources/what-is-a-wiki/), an image, or other resources on the website.

- Processing Requests: Apache interprets the request and identifies the specific resource being requested.

- Serving Content: Apache retrieves the requested resource (web page, image, etc.) from the web server's storage.

- Sending Responses: Once retrieved, Apache sends the requested content back to the user's web browser.

- Managing Traffic: Apache can handle multiple requests simultaneously, ensuring efficient handling of website traffic.

- Security: Apache can implement basic security measures like access control and authentication to protect website resources.

Benefits of Apache:

- Free and Open Source: Anyone can use and modify Apache freely, making it a cost-effective solution for web hosting.

- Stable and Reliable: Apache has been around for decades and is known for its stability and reliability, offering a solid foundation for web applications.

- Scalable: Apache can be configured to handle high traffic volumes, making it suitable for small and large websites alike.

- Platform Independent: Apache runs on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS, offering flexibility in deployment.

- Extensive Community: Apache has a large and active community of developers who provide support and contribute to its ongoing development.

Common use cases:

- Hosting static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Hosting dynamic websites built with server-side - scripting languages (PHP, Python, etc.)
- Running web applications
