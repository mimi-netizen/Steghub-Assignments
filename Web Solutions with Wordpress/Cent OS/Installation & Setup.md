## Introduction

CentOS 9 is a powerful, enterprise-class Linux distribution derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This guide aims to provide a comprehensive walkthrough for installing CentOS 9, ensuring you have a solid foundation for your server or desktop environment.

## Step 1: Download CentOS 8/9 ISO Image

You can easily get an ISO image of all released versions of CentOS. On the website of [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/), you can get the list of all available mirrors in the world.

For better download speed choose the mirror in your region.

- Get the list here: https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mirrormanager/mirrors/CentOS
- Or direct download ISO from here: http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/8/isos/x86_64/

After Download the ISO image, you can verify the image with the size and SHA256 hash value.

## Step 2: Create a bootable USB drive

After download the ISO image the next thing we required is a bootable USB drive.

On a Windows PC, you can create a bootable USB of CentOS by using [YUMI](https://pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/) or [RUFUS](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [balena etcher](https://etcher.balena.io). All are very simple and reliable ways to make a bootable USB.

If you on Linux then you can create bootable USB using the dd command like the below example.

```bash
sudo dd if=/path_to_iso_file/CentOS-8-x86_64-1905-dvd1.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress && sync
```

Note: replace path_to_iso_file with your iso file path and also replace /dev/sdb by your USB device path. If you donâ€™t know your USB device path you can run the below command to see it.

```bash
sudo lsblk
```

#### Virtual Box

For installation in Virtual Box, we do not need a bootable USB media. You can just click on Create New Virtual Machine and Select Redhat 64 Bit.

Also, allot RAM and Storage according to your choice.

**Remember a minimum of 1.5 GB RAM and 10 GB HDD is required.**

Now go under the Storage option and choose CentOS 8 or 9(depends on what you decided to download) ISO image file in Virtual Optical Drive.

## Step 9: Choose the partitioning scheme

Note: Be careful when making choices in this process. You may lose your data if the wrong option selected.

In the SYSTEM section, the first option is for configuring Disk partition and choose the installation destination for our server.

Disk partitioning is one of the most important parts of the OS installation.

### Step 9.1: Automatic Partition Configuration

If you do not want to create manual partitions, just select the disk, select Storage Configuration as automatic and click on Done. In this method, all the disk space is used and partitions are created automatically.

Note: This process deletes all your partitions and data on the disk.

### Step 9.2: Custom Partition Configuration

If you want to install CentOS 8/9 on a disk, where you already have some partition then you should select the custom partition option.

![image]

After that, you will see the below menu where you have to select the partition scheme and create new partitions. For example, in the below image I select the Standard partition scheme.

![image]

Now, We have to create mount points like the image below.

![image]

After creating all the necessary mount points, your partition table looks like the below image.

![image]

After that, verify all the changes will be done in the partition table and click on Accept Changes when done.

## Step 10: Configure Network and Hostname

You should have a configured network connection during the installation process because the network connection is required to update all the components during installation.

![image]

Also, you can define the hostname of the server.

## Step 11: Begin the installation

Now, we are ready to start the installation process of our CentOS 8/9 Server.

Now set a strong password for the root user.

![image]

## Step 13: Reboot and accept the license agreement

When the installation process is completed you have to reboot the server.
